# cas04_traitsyndromes

This document contains pointers to the general project files and information on the project in general. 

## Project background

The repository contains simulation code, analysis and visualisations for a project on evolution of trait syndromes in the Mediterranean climate. 

## Files

The current working directory is on Dropbox/shared_traitsyndromes. This contains folders for code, figures, manuscript and simulation results. 

### Simulation code

The code directory contains a raw simulation code file, which can be modified to run simulations of any parameter specification. 

For running simulations, create a copy of that file in a subfolder of 'simresults', and edit the file accordingly. Pay particular attention to edit

- target folder
- simulation title
- target parameters
- check: constant or change scenario

### Analytical code

The most functions for analysing or visualising are placed in `functions.R`. 

### Figures

Each figure should be created by a standalone code file (in `code`-directory). Currently, many of the figure plots are still specified in `Figures_Article_6.R`. The pdf output is to be directed to the `figures` directory. 

### Manuscript

The manuscript is currently being developed in Overleaf. A snapshot of the pre-submission manuscript will be placed in the `manuscript` directory.
